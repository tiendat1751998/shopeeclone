# Centralized Metrics & Tracing Configurations

We use OpenTelemetry APIs to instrument every microservice and export metrics/traces to Prometheus and Tempo/Jaeger.

## OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration (`otel-collector.yaml`)
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 256

exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
    namespace: "shopee"
  otlp/tempo:
    endpoint: "tempo:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/tempo]
